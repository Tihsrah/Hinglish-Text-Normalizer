Online technologies have started blooming recently, and all our tasks have shifted to digital mode. Reviews play an essential part in our online purchases, 
from online shopping based on product reviews to deciding whether to go for a movie based on movie reviews. Allotting sentiments for all such reviews to 
segregate them into positives and negatives wasn't manually possible; hence, some research began in this sector. Not much research has been done on this, 
so our project adds to this research for further classification tasks that can be added to the pipeline and help in the sentiment analysis of the reviews. 
For the ease of writing reviews, people in India prefer to pen down their opinions in Hinglish rather than just English or Hindi. Our technique processes and
analysis such Hinglish datasets using technologies like Python, Scikit learn and transformers (for future purposes), and libraries like Indic translate, Indic 
transliterate, Nltk, Pandas, Regex and Enchant.
